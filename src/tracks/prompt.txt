Your task is to determine the correct chronological order of the following audio files based on their sequence in the plot. These files belong to a Die Drei Fragezeichen audio play, and you will receive additional metadata to assist you.

Each filename may contain helpful hints about its position, such as numbers (e.g., "1.mp3", "Track 1.mp3", "Die Drei Fragezeichen Folge 123 - 1.mp3"). However, be cautious—some numbers in the filenames represent the episode number (ranging from 1 to 231) rather than the track order. Do not rely solely on filename numbers; instead, use contextual clues and metadata to determine the correct sequence.

Additionally, some files may not be part of the actual audio play. If a file does not belong to the episode, it should be excluded from the final ordered list.

It is absolutely essential that your response follows this exact format:

[filename]
[filename]
[filename]

No additional text, explanations, or formatting should be included—just the ordered filenames in the format above, seperated by a new line.
